<ul>
<li> PupperAI is a quadruped (4-legged) robot controlled by signal generated by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model.</li>
<li> PupperAI have one goal in mind, which is to <strong> walk as far as it can on 1000 steps of simulation.</strong></li>
<li> DRL trained on 2 stages : <strong>Pre-training</strong> on simulation and <strong>fine-tuning</strong> on the actual robot.</li>
<li> On simulation PupperAI able to <strong>surpass the baseline performance within 2M steps</strong> of training.</li>
<li> <strong>Domain randomization</strong> and <strong>Transfer Learning</strong> was used to close the gap between simulation and reality.</li>
</ul>"
